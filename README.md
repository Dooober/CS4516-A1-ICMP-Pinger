# Advanced Networks Project 1 - ICMP Pinger

This project was written in C. I have compiled the program for linux using a docker dev environment.

## How to run the program

1. The program must be run on linux. A devcontainer.json file is attached for easily creating a docker container in vscode.
2. If the program needs to be compiled use the command ```gcc main.c -o main```
3. Use the command ```sudo ./main {hostname}``` to run the program with the given hostname.
